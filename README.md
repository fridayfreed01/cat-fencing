Week 6 - MVP where is she?

Table 6 has been hard at work! We’re getting our pixels lined up, and our syntax sorted out. What is an MVP you ask? Unfortunately, while our game does involve a sport (Fencing), this is not our Most Valuable Player. An MVP in this context is the Minimal Viable Product. This version is by no means a fully functional game, but it does work and the core concepts are there. 

Yue Shi, our lovely artist for this project, has started work on developing the style for our characters, background, and more. We’ve got 2 characters for this MVP: Clover and Peanut. Currently we have a temp background, as Yue Shi is still working on figuring out what the ~vibe~ of the background/level area will be.

Sage, our designer, deffo put in the work too. Our team's initial concept for the cards were pretty solid drawing inspiration from the olympic style of fencing. Utilizing information from our resident fencer, Bri, Sage came up with a balancing system for our 5 initial cards. Each card beats 2 others and is weak to 2. Think Rock/Paper/Scissors but if you had 5 options and each did slightly different damage. Sage is also beginning to look into what our UI could look like and how it may function.

Seth, our fearless programmer, has been pulling all these different concepts together and making them into a functional game! So far the player can pick a card, and when they choose one so does the AI. Based on the Rock/Paper?Scissors Sage made, the cards go head to head. Whoever loses gets health points knocked off them. When you run out of health, you lose the match.

As our Producer and local fencing expert, I’ve been working to help us stay organized (You should see our Google Drive and Discord!). I’ve also assisted Yue Shi and Sage with some of their design needs. We’ve also got a team logo in the works.
